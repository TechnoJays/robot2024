        Sets the scaling factor (`_dpad_scaling`) for "fine" control over the tank drive from the directional pad
        Sets the scaling factor (`_stick_scaling`) for general control of the tank drive from the joysticks

        Set up for "Slew Rate Limiting" based on button modifier input. If the "Slew Rate" button is compressed,
        then the robot tank drive will not use the direct input from the joystick. Instead, it will apply a
        maximum rate of change to the joystick input.

        Caveat: The way the slew rate is applied, it will also affect deceleration of the robot. That means that
        if the slew rate modifier button is depressed, that the robot will not immediately come to a stop when
        the joystick is released, it will slowly decelerate (fast deceleration is one of the primary reasons for
        robot tipping)
